Reliable E-Commerce platform on AWS


### **E-commerce Platform: Built on AWS & Serverless**

-----

### **Overview**

Welcome to our open-source e-commerce platform\! This project is built almost entirely on a **serverless architecture** using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. Our goal is to provide a highly scalable, cost-effective, and robust foundation for building modern online stores. The platform's modular design allows you to easily customize and extend its functionality to fit any business need, from small startups to large-scale enterprises.

### **Key Features**

  * **100% Serverless**: No servers to manage, no scaling worries. We use services like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to handle everything.
  * **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use, which dramatically reduces operational costs compared to traditional setups.
  * **Microservices Architecture**: The platform is composed of independent services for the product catalog, shopping cart, user authentication, and more, making it easy to develop and deploy specific features without affecting the whole system.
  * **Headless**: The back-end is completely decoupled from the front-end. This gives you the freedom to build your storefront using any technology you want—React, Vue, or a static site generator.
  * **Highly Scalable**: Built to handle massive traffic spikes and rapid growth without any manual intervention.

### **Technology Stack**

  * **Backend**: AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS DynamoDB, AWS S3, AWS SNS, AWS SQS, AWS Cognito
  * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: [**AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)**](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)
  * **Front-end**: (Link to your front-end repository or mention the technology, e.g., "The front-end is built with React. See the repository here: [link to your front-end repo]")

### **Getting Started**

Ready to get your own e-commerce store up and running? Follow these simple steps.

#### **Prerequisites**

  * **Node.js** (version 18 or later)
  * **npm**
  * **AWS CLI** configured with your AWS credentials
  * **AWS SAM CLI** installed and configured

#### **Installation & Deployment**

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```
2.  **Build the application**:
    ```bash
    sam build
    ```
3.  **Deploy to your AWS account**:
    ```bash
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
    This command will walk you through the deployment process, prompting for a stack name, AWS region, and other configuration options.

After the deployment is complete, the `sam deploy` command will output the API Gateway endpoints. You can then connect your front-end application to these endpoints.
